h1. Play-Search module for Play 1.1

This version of the play-search module is based on my fork of the original code (<a href="http://github.com/jfp/play-search">jfp/play-search</a>).

h2. Changings

My fork is based on the last version of play-search module (never released).

What has changed :

<ol><li>Play 1.1RC1 has lost Lucene lib, so I added the same version in the module (lucene-2.3.1).</li>

<li>Play 1.1RC1 has deprecated JPASupport class, so I migrated the module to JPABase, the new JPA superclass.</li>

</ol>

h2. Tests

This version of the module is working with my applications.

Contact me if you find some bugs.
